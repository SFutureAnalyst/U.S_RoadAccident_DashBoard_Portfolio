## Project Description

Road safety is a significant issue that affects communities everywhere. As part of this project, I developed a robust tool called the Road Accident Analytics Dashboard, which is intended to analyze and display data on road accidents for the years 2021 and 2022. With the help of this Excel-based dashboard, stakeholders can make data-driven decisions and create a safer driving environment.

## Tech Stack Used 

![Excel](https://img.icons8.com/color/256/microsoft-excel-2019.png)

## Skills showcased in this Project

- Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data Analysis
- Filtering, Sorting and Conditional function.
- Pivot Tables and Pivot Chart
- Data Visulisation and Dashboard creation

## Requirements and KPIs

Clients want to create a road accident dashboard for the years 2021 and 2022 so that they can have insight on following aspects-

- Primary KPI - Total Casualties and Total Accident values for Current Year and YoY growth
- Primary KPI's-Total Casualties by Accident Severity for Current Year and YoY growth
- Secondary KPIs - Total Casualties concerning vehicle type for the Current Year
- Monthly trend showing a comparison of casualties for the Current Year and the Previous Year
- Casualties by Road Type for the Current Year
- Current Year Casualties by Area/ Location & by Day/Night
- Total Casualties and Total Accidents by Location

## Data Sourcing

The dataset can be found https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents

## Data Cleaning and Transformation

This stage began with getting to know the dataset and checking for any data quality issues.
1.	Checking NULL values, blanks and Errors 
2.	Removing duplicates, and irrelevant columns.
3.	Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
4.	Creating 2 new attributes 'Year' and 'Month' were added for logical and easy interpretation of dataset.

## Data Analysis

To make the job of a new user, developer, or client easier, I created a "Data Analysis" sheet that summarizes all the pivot table data. To help summarize the data and spot trends in the dataset, nine pivot tables were made on this sheet, with a focus on the relationships between the number of casualties and various variables like the type of casualty, the type of vehicle, the type of road, the location, etc. For the years 2021 and 2022, monthly trends were also examined.

Below is a snippet of the Data Analysis Sheet

## Data Visualization

By inserting and modifying the pivot charts of the matching pivot table, the dashboard was finally completed. Timelines and slicers were included for an interactive and user-friendly experience. Additionally, connections and hyperlinks were added to the essential icons to enable seamless navigation.

Below is a snippet of the final dashboard in Excel.

## Key Insights

üìà Total Casualties Analysis: The dashboard reveals that a staggering 417,883 casualties occurred after accidents during the two-year period

üìÖ Peak Months: Overall the number of casulaties were slightly higher in 2021 than 2022. Maximum Casualties happened in the month of October and November in both the Years and minimum casualties take place in  the month of January and February.

üöó Casualties by Vehicle Type: Car accidents accounted for the highest number of casualties, contributing to 79.8% of the total. On the other hand, casualties were minimal in accidents involving other vehicle types.

ü©∏ Casualties by accident severity Slight severity form the bulk of casualties 84.1% whereas there are only 1.7% Fatal severity casualties.

üõ£Ô∏è Road Type Analysis: Maximum Casualties by Single Carriageway road type (310.1K) and Minimum by Slip road(5.1K)

üåßÔ∏è Casualties Distribution by Road Surface: Highest Distribution of total casualties on Dry road surfaces (67%)

üèôÔ∏è Casualties Relation by Area/Location Urban areas form the majority of casualties after an accident (61%)

‚òÄÔ∏è Casualties Distribution by light condtion: 73% of casulties take place in daylight condtion

## Recommendations based on the Analysis

1. Critical periods in October and November are identified by the dashboard through monthly comparisons of casualty trends between the current and past years. During these times of high risk, the traffic police and other stakeholders need to be proactive and focused in their efforts to improve road safety. 
2. Since drivers account for the majority of fatalities, it is important to focus awareness campaigns, rigorous monitoring, and recurring safety inspections on their driving habits.
3. Wherever possible, single-carryaway roads should have double lanes added, along with additional safety precautions.
4. Recognizing the distribution of casualties according to various road surface conditions aids in identifying regions that require surface enhancements and road maintenance. 
5. Interventions aimed at enhancing road safety in particular and during urban areas.


## End

With the help of this Road Accident Analytics Dashboard, stakeholders can make data-driven decisions and put into practice evidence-based interventions that improve road safety. It is an important tool for safety advocates, traffic authorities, and legislators alike.
